Description: This package calculates the Quasi-likelihood under the Independence
    Model Criterion (QAIC) and the Quasi-likelihood under the Independence model 
    Criterion (QIC) for Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) models. The 
    package provides tools to assess and compare the fit of GEE models using 
    both QAIC and QIC, which are useful for model selection in various types of 
    regression models, including Gaussian, binomial, and Poisson families.
